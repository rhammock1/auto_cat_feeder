# Automatic Cat Feeder

This project uses a "Parent" ESP32 and the ESP-NOW protocal to connect with 
other "Child" ESP32s. Each ESP32 is used to control a servo motor that dispenses
food to a cat.

## Future Plans
* Add a web-interface to allow configuration of the feeding schedule and other settings
* Add remote logging to keep track of what's going on for debugging purposes
* Setting a static IP address for the parent ESP32
